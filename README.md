# mandelbrot
A small project to calculate and draw the mandelbrot set.
## Mandelbrot set
Let's consider the following function of complex numbers :
```
f[c]: x -> x^2 + c
```
The mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers c for which iterating 0 over f[c] converges.
## Goal
The goal of this project is to iterate this function over different values of c and draw the convergeant results using simple color coding.
